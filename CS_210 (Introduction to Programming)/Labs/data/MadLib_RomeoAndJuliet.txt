Two _plural_noun_ , both alike in dignity,
In fair _place_ , where we lay our scene,
From ancient _noun_ break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd _plural_noun_ take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their _noun_ bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their _adjective_ love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could _verb_ ,
Is now the _number_ hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with _adjective_ _body_part_ attend,
What here shall _verb_ , our toil shall strive to mend.
