Jack and Jill went up the _noun_ ,
To _verb_ a pail of _liquid_ ;
Jack _verb_ending_in_ed_ down, and broke his _noun_ ,
And Jill came _verb_ending_in_ing_ after.

Then up Jack got and off did _verb_ ,
As _adjective_ as he could caper,
To old Dame Dob, who patched his _noun_
With _noun_ and _adjective_ paper.
