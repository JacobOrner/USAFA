Dear _relative_ ,

I am having a(n) _adjective_ time at camp. The counselour is _adjective_
and the food is _adjective_ . I met _name_of_person_in_room_ and we became
_adjective_ friends. Unfortunately, _name_of_person_in_room_ is _adjective_
and I _verb_ending_in_ed_ my _body_part_ so we couldn`t go _verb_ending_in_ing_ like
everybody else. I need more _plural_noun_ and a _noun_ sharpener, so please _adverb_
_verb_ more when you _verb_ back.

Your _relative_ ,
_person_in_room_
