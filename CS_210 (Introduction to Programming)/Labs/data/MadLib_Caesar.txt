Friends, Romans, _noun_plural_ , lend me your _body_part_plural_ ;
I come to _verb_ Caesar, not to _verb_ him.
The _sport_ that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their _noun_plural_ :
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was _adjective_ :
If it were so, it was a grievous _noun_ ;
And grievously hath Caesar _verb_ending_in_ed_ it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, --
For Brutus is a/an _adjective_ man;
So are they all, all _adjective_ men, --
Come I to _verb_ in Caesar's funeral.
He was my _noun_ , faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was _adjective_ ;
And Brutus is a/an _adjective_ man.
He hath brought _adjective_ captives home to Rome,
Whose _noun_plural_ did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem _adjective_ ?
When that the poor have _verb_ending_in_ed_ , Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of _adjective_ stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was _adjective_ ;
And Brutus is a/an _adjective_ man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I _number_ time(s) presented him a kingly _noun_ ,
Which he did _number_ time(s) refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was _adjective_ ;
And, sure, he is a/an _adjective_ man.
I _verb_ not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to _verb_ what I do know.
